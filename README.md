# recipeproject
Recipe Project for The Odin Project. Learning HTML basics. This project was initially created on 10/6/2025. The project will allow me to review basic HTML such as creating headings, links, adding images and making bold and italicized text. This project won't be pretty, but as I learn more, I will comeback to periodically update it with CSS and JavaScript.
