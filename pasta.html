    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul><li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup sifted all-purpose flour</li></ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol><li>Gather the ingredients</li>
        <li>Combine egg, milk, and salt in a bowl. Add sifted flour and stir until a dough forms, adding more flour as needed, a little at a time, for the dough to come together. Separate into two balls.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a work surface with flour and roll out each piece of dough as thin as you like. Let rolled dough rest for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut into strips and spread to dry, dusting with a bit of flour so the noodles don't stick together. Let dry for approximately 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Cook noodles in boiling salted water, or hot soup, until tender, about 10 minutes.</li></ol>
